Webship Diagram
===============

A fork of the [for-GET](https://github.com/for-GET/http-decision-diagram)
utility to represent the HTTP flow of `webship`, which is based on an older
set of rules.

## TODO

1. Generate json file from the `Decision.hs` code
2. Add support for tracing a path
2. Embed assets in to `webship` and serve up under a system resource
